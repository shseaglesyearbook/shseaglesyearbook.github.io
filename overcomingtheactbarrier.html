                <div class="post-content text-left">
                  <p>When determining if a student is eligible for admissions and scholarships, college admissions counselors rely on two data points: the student's GPA and ACT score. For most college bound students, maintaining an admissible GPA is the easy part. However, for many students, especially low-income and first-generation students, the ACT often creates a barrier to college access.</p>
                  <p>One reason for this is the cost of the exam. At $46 per attempt, students may not be able to afford the test, or may not be able to retake it to improve their score. Since funding for the free statewide junior ACT was cut this year, low-income students now have even fewer opportunities to take the test. To counter this, we increased our outreach to students who qualify for the fee waiver. After having a registration drive in late September, we had 80 students registered for the October test, many of which took advantage of the waiver. This is double the average registration for a single test here at SHS.</p>
                  <p>Another admissions barrier relating to the ACT is the result of low test scores. The state average in Missouri is a 21, and most colleges require a minimum of a 21-24 to be admitted. Scholarships typically start at the 24 mark and increase with the score. Before the October ACT, 58.6% of the senior class scored below the state average. This meant many students either would not be admitted to the school of their choice, or would not receive a scholarship to make it affordable.</p>
                  <p>Realizing that lack of affordable and accessible ACT prep was one probable contributing factor, we decided to ramp up our ACT prep efforts. Enlisting the help of the math and English departments, we held 15 prep sessions, covering all four ACT subjects. More than 30 students attended prep sessions. To reward these students for their efforts, any student attending 3+ sessions was entered to win a raffle prize. All 16 students who met this criterion received a prize!</p>
                  <p>Scores have started to come in from the October test, and overall, most students saw an increase in their score. Registration for the December ACT is also up, and students are continuing to ask about prep opportunities. Learning the importance of a good ACT score, SHS students rose to the challenge and are taking the steps necessary to improve their scores and leverage opportunities using the fee waiver. Way to step up, SHS! Keep up the momentum!</p>
